### Overview
This readme file describes the files used to create a SQL database of assignment submissions and evaluations according to instructions in the EfDS assignment.
Specifically, it contains an Entity-Relationship diagram of the database, definitions of necessary classes and methods written using SQLAlchemy, SQL code for the construction of the database in SQL, and a notebook that generates data to populate the database. 

The database itself is designed to contain information about students, tasks (i.e. sets of questions) assigned to students, and evaluations of task submissions completed by teachers.
